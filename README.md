# ModAnimalCommonality-Generator

heres the mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2845066201&searchtext=mod+animal+commonality

this generates patches that go into `Mod Animal Commonality/Patches/modanimalcommonality_patches.xml`

it scans recursively in chosen folder (but it needs about.xml). You can also point it to the whole workshop folder to get a menu for all mods you are subsrcrimbled to, and then replace my patch with generated oned although look at my patch i think there is some stuff you also need to put at the end.
